# Draft Picks

A simple tool to help you make sure the changes you intended to make are
the only changes (visually at least) that have been made.



### Usage:
-----------------------

Modify sites.json with your own pages.

```
python differ.py
```


In the following sites.json example file, the pages that
would be compared are:

sqor.com/ vs. stage.sqor.com
sqor.com/sport/mlb vs stage.sqor.com/sport/ufc

```

{
    "pages": [
        [ "/",  "/sport/nfl", "/sport/mlb"]
        ,[  "/", "/sport/nba", "/sport/ufc" ]
    ]

    ,   "siteBase01": "http://sqor.com"
    ,   "siteBase02": "http://stage.sqor.com"
}

```


### Seeing your report
The report will be generated into a directory with prefix: report_*


Since we are loading the report.json with ajax you can run a quick and simple
http server:

``` 
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
```
Then point your browser to: localhost:8080/

There your directory report_* will be listed.


You should see somethign like this when you click on the repor folder, you
should see:


###  Diff Shot
Each row is red if there are differences for that site comparison
On mouse over the red, you will see the actual diff between the two pages

### Page 01
This is the first page used for the above diff shot, in this case /sport/mlb  

### Page 02
This is the second page used for the diff shot, in this case /sport/ufc
